# 📄 TARS Loop: Autonomous Research Review & Iteration

## 🚀 Vision

Accelerate scientific progress by building an AI-powered research improvement loop where agents critique, authors iterate, and every change is tracked with context.  
Replace static peer review with a dynamic, transparent, and collaborative review ecosystem powered by autonomous agents.

---

## 🧩 The TARS Loop Workflow

### 📄 Submit Draft  
Upload a paper (PDF or LaTeX) to initiate the TARS critique cycle.

### 🤖 TARS Critique  
Autonomous agents with distinct reviewer personas (theorist, empiricist, philosopher, skeptic...) comment inline and in threaded discussions.

### 🛠️ Author Iteration  
Authors respond, revise, or reject feedback. Agent suggestions can be semi-automated or integrated with an AI co-author.

### 📈 Changelog Creation  
Every change is auto-logged, tagged to reviewer feedback, and versioned in a visual timeline.

### 🧪 Final Peer Review  
Human or agentic peer reviewers conduct a final review, readying the paper for journal submission, arXiv upload, or community publishing.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

| Problem | TARS Loop Solves |
|--------|------------------|
| Slow, opaque peer review | Transparent, interactive feedback in hours, not months |
| Lack of constructive critique | Multi-agent diversity ensures multidimensional feedback |
| No audit trail for evolution | Full changelog links critique → revision → rationale |
| AI authorship lacks accountability | Traceable agent interventions and authorship attribution |

## 🔧 Built With

- **LLM-based reviewers**: Fine-tuned or prompt-engineered critique agents (e.g. Formalist, Red Team, Historian)  
- **Version-aware document platform**: Git-like version control for research papers  
- **Citation graph integration**: Agents pull related work, detect missing references  
- **Export-ready formats**: arXiv/Overleaf/LaTeX PDF support  

---

## 🎯 Target Users

- Independent researchers, PhD students, and lab groups  
- Open science communities (arXiv, bioRxiv, OpenReview)  
- Journals seeking AI-augmented review layers  
- Tool builders in the academic knowledge graph & GenAI space  

---

## 🌐 Differentiation

- 🧠 **Agentic Peer Review**: More than summarization—each agent has a viewpoint and contributes argumentation.  
- 📊 **Explainable Revisions**: Every edit has a *why*, not just a *what*.  
- 🔁 **Continuous Publishing**: Move from one-shot publication to a living document with evolving quality.  

---

## 💡 Strategic Direction

- Launch as an Overleaf plugin or arXiv-sidecar tool  
- Open protocol for agent-based research improvement  
- Integrate with GitHub for papers-as-code (e.g. Manubot, Jupyter)
